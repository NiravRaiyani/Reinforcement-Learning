# Reinforcement-Learning
The work in this repository is a simple extension of the work done by Vaibhav Kumar in (https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-temporal-difference-sarsa-q-learning-expected-sarsa-on-python-9fecfda7467e). This repository demonstrates the implementation of SARSA, Q-Learning and Expected SARSA to the [GYM - FrozenLake8x8-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake8x8-v0/), an ```OpenAI``` environmental simulator.
